# The Ocean Cleanup - Visual Survey App

## Introduction

Welcome to the app repository for The Ocean Cleanup Visual Surveys. The goals of the Ocean Cleanup visual surveys will be to improve the current estimate of the total mass of ocean plastic floating at the world’s ocean. The app is developed in order to support the research and expeditions to determine the dimension and amounts of ocean plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch – an accumulation zone for debris forming between Hawaii and California during the [mega expedition](http://www.theoceancleanup.com/technology/mega-expedition/).

## App

The goal of the app is to make visual surveys user-friendlier and reduce administrative load. Based on Appcelerator Titanium, the app will allow users to report sightings which are uploaded and collected for further analysis. As the mega expedition has been completed we are looking to ways to improve the app for the general public.

## Getting Started

### Quick start

In order to build the project clone the project and read how to get started with Titanium on [http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#!/guide/Quick_Start](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Quick_Start).

### Configuration

In order not to spill sensitive information all over the internet the config file is left blank, without it you will not be able to upload any surveys to the server. You can find the [code](https://github.com/TheOceanCleanup/server) for the server in the organisation and run it yourself, or contact any of the contributors of this project with the request for the development and/or production configurations.

### Documentation

The Visual Survey app uses JSDuck for documentation. In order to generate the documantation install JSDuck on your machine. Generated documentation is located in the /docs/ directory. Simply open the index.html page and enjoy.
